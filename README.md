<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

This is a simple project for me to practise React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS. I really enjoyed making this app as I haven't really had the chance to work on any side-projects. However, hoping this one might be the jumpstart for fixing that!

### Built With

The project in itself is fairly simple and minimalistic. It is built with a modern stack, including:

- React
- TailwindCSS
- Vite
- TypeScript
- [The Cat API](https://thecatapi.com/)

And that's pretty much it!
